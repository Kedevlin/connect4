# Connect Four 

### A RESTful web application written in Node.js with Restify, Socket.io, and Bunyan. 

#### To play: 
1. Git clone this repo. 
2. Run node server from the directory in your terminal. 
3. Open http://localhost:8080/ on two web browsers and click "Join Game" from each (the first will be player 1, the second will be player 2). Only one game can be played at once. 
4. Start game play with player 1's turn. 
5. Click on a column to place a tile in that column. Continue alternating turns between player 1 and 2. 
6. Game ends when either a player has acheived 4 consecutive tiles in a row, column, or diagonal, or the board is full. Users can choose to play again or close the browser.
